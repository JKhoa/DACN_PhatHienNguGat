### ðŸ“Š Model Performance Comparison

#### Test Results (on cap_000000.jpg):

| Model | Version | Inference Time | Detections | Avg Confidence | Max Confidence | Min Confidence |
|-------|---------|---------------|------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **YOLOv11n** | v11 | 304.89ms | 1 person | 0.896 | 0.896 | 0.896 |
| **YOLOv8n-Custom** | v8 | 122.04ms | 7 persons | 0.495 | 0.818 | 0.357 |

#### Key Findings:
